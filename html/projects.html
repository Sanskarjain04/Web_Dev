    <h2>Trip Planner</h2><br>
    <h3>A Website to plan trips for the people who wants to go on a trip.</h3><br>
    <h3>How it works:-</h3><p>We used GPT3 to make this project, we used the GPT3 API key and connected our website with GPT3 Playgroung.<br>The website asks three thing:<br></p>
    <p>1.The starting day of the trip.<br>2.The end day of the trip.<br>3.The Place where you want to go.<br></p>
    <p>After giving these three information the website sends the information to GPT3, it receives the information, generates a plan and sends it back to the website and the website shows the plan to the user on the screen.</p>
